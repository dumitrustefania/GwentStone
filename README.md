* Gwent Stone
  -  the program is an implementation of a game created by combining the Gwent
  and HearttStone gameplay
  -  2 players are competing against each other by using their cards'
  various abilities

__Classes__

`fileio`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- CardInput -> contains fields that define a card, like mana, health, name,
               attack damage, etc.
- Coordinates -> contains x & y coordinates (for specifying a certain card
                 on the table)
- ActionsInput -> contains fields that define a required action, like the
                  command name, player index, etc
- DecksInput -> contains fields that define a player's decks
- StartGameInput -> contains fields that define the characteristics of a match,
                    like a player's hero or deck
- GameInput -> contains a StartGameInput field and an array of ActionsInput
- Input -> main input class, used to extract the input data from every JSON file
        -> contains a couple of DecksInput deck sets and a GameInput field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`main`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Main -> the main program where the test files are opened the output tests 
          are created and then every test is checked by the checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`game`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Game -> used as the starting point of the game
       -> initialises the 2 players by assigning them their decks
       -> creates the matches and starts them one by one 
                
- Match -> used as the starting point of a match
        -> starts the match by assigning the decks for this match
           and shuffling them
        -> plays the game turn by turn, following the actions given as input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`players`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Player -> contains all the necessary data about a player
         -> performs certain player specific methods, like adding a card in
            hand or reinitialising the player at the start of a match
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`table`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Table -> the actual table where the cards are put
        -> contains helper methods for accessing and modifying the cards 
           on the table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`actions`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Action -> class used to create 5 different types of actions, based on
            the command name
         -> its children classes override the performAction() method
         
- DebugAction -> performs one of the debug actions, based on the
                 command name and extra input

- EnvironmentAction -> creates an object depending on the environment
                       card's name and proceeds to use its ability
             
- HeroActions -> creates an object depending on the hero card's name and
                 proceeds to use its ability

- MinionAction -> performs one of the minion actions, based on the command
                  name and extra input
               -> the Minion card can can:
                      --> attack an enemy card
                      --> attack the opponent's hero
                      --> create an object depending on the minion card's
                          name and use its ability
                      
- PlayerAction -> perform the only player action: placing a card on the table                      
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`abilities`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Ability -> an interface to be used for defining card abilities
      
- EnvironmentAbility -> abstract class for defining an environment card ability
                     -> classes that extend it and implement the specific ability:
                         --> Firestorm
                         --> HeartHound
                         --> Winterfell
- HeroAbility -> abstract class for defining a hero ability
              -> classes that extend it and implement the specific ability:
                         --> EmpressThorina
                         --> GeneralKocioraw
                         --> KingMudface
                         --> LordRoyce
                                  
- MinionAbility -> abstract class for defining a minion card ability
                -> classes that extend it and implement the specific ability:
                         --> Cursed
                         --> Disciple
                         --> Miraj
                         --> Ripper                            
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`util`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Constants -> storing constants used in the implementation

- JsonOut -> used for easily appending the necessary JSON values to 
             the ArrayNode output
          -> all its fields have the same name as the one required 
             in the JSON output files
          -> some integer fields have their default value -1 because
             they should not be displayed in case they are not required
             in the output. To do this, a special Json tag is included
             near each field

- MyIntFilter -> used for the Json tag mentioned above
              -> filters out every integer value with the default value -1      
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
----------------------------------------------------
How does it work?

* The Main class is the entry point of the program. It creates an
Input instance using the input JSON file. It also creates a Game
instance, that calls the playGame() method with the ArrayNode 
output parameter. This starts the actual game.

* Certain initialisations are performed in the playGame() method of 
the Game object. It then creates a Match instance for each match that 
has to be played, calling its startGame() method.

* Some more match-specific initialisations are also performed in the 
startGame() method of the Match object. The match then takes action,
with the playRounds() method call.

* For each player's turn, commands from the input are performed until
reaching the 'endPlayerTurn' command. The other player continues with
his commands after that.

* Each command is performed with the help of the Action class. It is 
the first to process each action and redirect it to the corresponding
class based on its command name, by creating an instance of the respective
class (DebugAction / HeroAction / MinionAction etc.) and calling the
performAction() method.

* Each subclass of actions checks the command name and performs it 
accordingly. Some comands, though, are different based on the card 
type that has to execute it (the environment, hero and minion abilities). 
For performing these special abilities, the corresponding ability 
class is instantiated, based on the card name, and the useAbility()
* method is called to perform the ability.

* For each command that requires an output, a JsonOut object is 
instantiated and the information about the executed command is 
added to it. It then gets appended to the overall game output.
